## ToDo:
- [x] Finish building json with level data
- [x] Parse level data into player dict
- [x] Decide how to split levels on front end
- [ ] Build collasable tables for each level
- [ ] Build display buttons for each game


## Thoughts:
Add links to walkthrough videos in level data json

Add achievement types. IE: Skull, Terminal, Par Time/Score

If above then allow user to split/sort by types
