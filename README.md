## ToDo:
- [ ] Finish building json with level data
- [ ] Parse level data into player dict
- [ ] Decide how to split levels on front end

## Thoughts:
Add links to walkthrough videos in level data json
Add achievement types. IE: Skull, Terminal, Par Time/Score
If above then allow user to split/sort by types
